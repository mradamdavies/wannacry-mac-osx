# wannacry-mac-osx
I found this malware sample while helping a friend fix his Macbook. It's essentially wannacry for Mac OSX!

It's a terminal one-liner, using native applications so was hard to block when it was released.

The code basicly encrypts the hard drive with a key, then sends the key to the C2 domain.

## Usage
Change `http://C2/`

Copy/paste to terminal

## Compatibility
Tested on Catalina 10.15.X.
No idea on support for other versions as I don't use or have access to a Mac.
